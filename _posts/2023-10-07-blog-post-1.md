I was missing the sea, the open sea. Even though I have adopted quite a salty water lifestyle nowadays, the dark blue open sea and the offshore waters hold a unique and special place in my heart.

During my PhD interview with my current supervisor, a scientific cruise was mentioned.

I've been on a couple of voyages and know the immense effort, both in terms of time and money, required for them to be successful. Thus, I was excited about the possibility, but it wasn't my main focus, to avoid disappointment.

However, now, on the 7th of October 2023, it is happening. My lab colleagues and I, along with many other scientists from different institutions, both Australian and international, are on board the RV Investigator
