First of all, I am a human being that for the most random reason decided to study oceanography far away from my family. My home country is Brazil and I am currently living in Sydney, where I am onboard of my PhD journey. 

This website is in progress and while I am trying to oriented myself in the middle of a buch of codes forked from a very nice person, you will see many changes and most likely many non sense things. Like this spontaneous introduction.

Welcome aboard.
