<span style="font-family:Garamond">
Physical oceanographer by training, I am currently studying and focusing on Western Boundary Current (WBC) systems, particularly the East Australia Current (EAC) System. The EAC is a highly variable and complex current, and my research is centered on examining its seasonal heat transport variability, both along-shore and cross-shore, as well as its mean state. An important aspect of the EAC System that cannot be overlooked is the presence of mesoscale eddies.

<span style="font-family:Garamond">
Given their significance in this region characterized by high eddy activity, especially following the detachment of the EAC shelf break, it is crucial to understand the contribution of mesoscale eddies to heat transport or retention in the area. Considering the increasing eddy activity and sea surface temperature in the region, it becomes important to understand the role of eddies in driving heat transport and its implications for future projections.

The (very colorful)  animation below depicts what is being referred to as the EAC System. It showcases the model results from SEA-COFS for surface current and sea surface temperature over a period of more than one year.

# My background
<span style="font-family:Garamond">
(Briefly and to be expanded later)

<span style="font-family:Garamond">
During my undergraduate and master's studies, I was drawn to beach morphodynamic studies due to my life circumstances at the time.

<span style="font-family:Garamond">
For my undergraduate thesis, I developed an algorithm (written in Matlab, which was the most common coding language used by oceanographers back then) to detect waterline displacement in video images. This, in conjunction with significant wave height, sea level, and foreshore steepness, allowed me to estimate waterline position remotely. The primary objective was to create a tool for real-time detection of changes in beach morphology (erosion and accretion) with high time resolution (hourly).

<span style="font-family:Garamond">
During my master's, I delved deeper into understanding infragravity waves (IG). Cassino Beach, being a highly dissipative beach, was expected to experience significant infragravity wave energy action. I demonstrated how the wave field on the beach foreshore changed over a seven-day period, with an increase in IG energy as a response to extreme events.

Additionally, I have industry experience, where I collaborated with different groups and was responsible for real-time data analysis on remote ocean platforms.
