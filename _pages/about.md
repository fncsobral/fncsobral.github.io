First of all, I am a human being that for the most random reason decided to study oceanography far away from my family. My home country is Brazil and I am currently living in Sydney-Australia, where I am currently crusing the chalenging seas of a PhD in physical oceanography. 

This website is (and perhaps will always be) in continuous development, and while I am trying to oriented myself in the middle of a bunch of codes forked from a very nice person, you will see many changes and most likely many non-sense things. Like this spontaneous introduction.

Welcome aboard.
